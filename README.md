# Scafall Collection Example

This project is an example of a colletion of scaffolding projects.  It generates a trivial python application and a trivial golang application.  If you would like to try it first install `scafall`:

```bash
$ go install github.com/AidanDelaney/scafall@latest
```

Then use this scaffolding to generate a new project:

```bash
$ scafall http://github.com/AidanDelaney/scafall-collection-eg.git collection-eg
```

You should be prompted to choose from the scaffolding collection.  Once a project scaffolding is chosen.  Follow the prompts and you will find the example project generated in a `collection-eg` directory.
